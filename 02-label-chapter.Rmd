# Label chapter

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(levels). This solution works fine online and PDF format but doesn't work in ePub format.

Other way to work with label chapter [Link to bibliography]. Work fine online and ePub format but PDF format get previous page.
